1- What are Composite Models in Power BI?
ANSWER: 
Composite Models allow combining Import Mode and DirectQuery in the same dataset, providing flexibility in handling large data.

2- How do you implement dynamic Row-Level Security (RLS)?
ANSWER:
Dynamic RLS is implemented using USERPRINCIPALNAME() or USERNAME() in DAX and filtering data dynamically based on the logged-in user.

3- How do you use Calculation Groups in Power BI?
ANSWER:
Calculation Groups help create reusable measures and time intelligence calculations, reducing duplication in DAX code.

4- What is Incremental Refresh in Power BI?
ANSWER:
Incremental Refresh loads only new or updated data, reducing the refresh time for large datasets.

5-Â How does Power BI handle Big Data?
ANSWER:
Power BI manages big data using:
Aggregations
DirectQuery mode
Dataflows
Azure Synapse integration
Composite models

6- What is the difference between a Power BI Dataflow and a Dataset?
ANSWER:
Dataflow: A reusable ETL pipeline stored in the Power BI Service.
Dataset: A processed data model that can be used for reporting.

7- How can you use Python or R in Power BI?
ANSWER:
Power BI allows scripting with Python or R for data transformation, visualization, and advanced analytics.

8- What is the use of Tabular Editor in Power BI?
ANSWER:
Tabular Editor is an external tool that allows advanced model editing, including managing measures, calculation groups, and metadata without opening Power BI Desktop.

9- How do you optimize DAX queries?
ANSWER:
Use SUMX instead of SUM for row-based calculations.
Reduce use of FILTER inside measures.
Use variables (VAR) for better performance.
Avoid CALCULATE unless necessary.
Use indexes and keys for optimized joins.

10- How can you enable real-time data streaming in Power BI?
ANSWER:
Real-time streaming can be enabled using Azure Stream Analytics, Power BI REST API, or Push Datasets.
