1- What is Row-Level Security (RLS) in Power BI?
ANSWER:
RLS is a feature in Power BI that restricts data access based on user roles. It is implemented using DAX filters in Power BI Desktop and applied in Power BI Service.

2- What is the difference between Import Mode and DirectQuery?
ANSWER:
Import Mode: Data is stored in Power BI and refreshed periodically.
DirectQuery: Data remains in the source and is queried live when users interact with the report.

3- How can you optimize Power BI performance?
ANSWER:
Use aggregations to reduce data size.
Optimize DAX formulas.
Remove unnecessary columns.
Use DirectQuery for large datasets.
Enable query folding for optimized queries.

4- What are Power BI Templates?
ANSWER:
Power BI Templates (.PBIT files) allow users to save report structure and queries without data, enabling reuse with different datasets.

5- What is a Common Data Model (CDM) in Power BI?
ANSWER:
CDM is a standardized schema for organizing and integrating data from various sources, ensuring consistency in data usage.

6- How do you use parameters in Power BI?
ANSWER:
Parameters allow users to input values dynamically, helping with filtering and customization in queries and reports.

7- What is a KPI in Power BI, and how do you create one?
ANSWER:
A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a visual representation of performance. It is created using KPI visuals, 
where the Target and Actual Value are compared.

8- How can you share Power BI reports securely?
ANSWER:
Reports can be shared using Power BI Service via:
Workspaces
Apps
Embedding reports
Exporting as PDF or PPT
Publishing to Power BI Report Server

9- What is the difference between Power BI Free, Pro, and Premium?
ANSWER:
Free: Limited to individual use, no sharing.
Pro: Allows sharing, collaboration, and advanced features.
Premium: Dedicated capacity, better performance, and large-scale data model support.

10- What is Power Automate, and how does it integrate with Power BI?
ANSWER:
Power Automate is a Microsoft tool for workflow automation. It integrates with Power BI to automate data refreshes, notifications, and report delivery.
